        <p class="lead mb-4">	‚ÄúIt was decided that we will move to California next month,‚Äù declared my parents, during a typical dinner back in South Korea. I finally got to live in the country I was born in, although I grew up in South Korea. Excitement flooded over me, with the thought of the new house, new friends, new school, new culture, and new environment. The hardships that I would soon face were obscured under such enthusiasm. 
I was in eighth grade when I immigrated to the United States, and some friends accepted and welcomed me with such warm hearts. However, there were also people that made fun of me for being ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù. They made fun of my clothes, my pale skin, and my broken English. Immediately, I bought new clothes, went out to the sun to be tan, but there was one thing that I couldn‚Äôt fix instantly: my English. The confidence and high self esteem that I grew up with vanished. Often times I imagine myself as an image: back then, I was stepped on, crumpled, ripped, and torn apart. Although I tried to glue them together and unfold them, I couldn‚Äôt because I was trapped in my own insecurities.
<br><br>

        The summer before high school my family moved to a different city and I eventually attended a different high school. I had to befriend new people in this whole entire new school, but it was okay. I was not the timid girl in eighth grade with broken English anymore. I made friends immediately, hiding my identity as an ‚Äúimmigrant‚Äù. School was still challenging, as it was only my second year in the new country, but what did it matter? I wasn‚Äôt bullied anymore. However, my real, ruined image was painted over with ‚Äúnormal‚Äù looking image. My self esteem was even lower, with insecurities, especially with the guilt that I was hiding my own culture. 
In my sophomore year, my Spanish teacher assigned my class with a project that was about sharing our life. The moment she announced the project, fear overwhelmed me; I was scared to mention that I grew up in South Korea. I did not want to be viewed with such stereotypes again. With such worries, I talked to my mom about how I did not want to be honest in this presentation. My mom answered, ‚ÄúWell, do you love Korea or not? Why are you so afraid to show what you love?‚Äù It was such a simple matter, yet I overcomplicated it. There was not a single moment where I didn‚Äôt like Korea, in fact I secretly always loved Korea and its culture. Korean food, the language, Korean jokes, and Korean people were the things I absolutely loved. The next day, in the presentations, I proudly told the class, ‚ÄúCrec√≠ en Corea,‚Äù: I grew up in Korea. After, I informed the class about Korea‚Äôs culture and how I grew up. This was the baby step that I took. I gradually developed an outgoing personality, as a result, I was back to the confident girl with high self-esteem. Loving oneself can change everything. I was able to be ‚Äúreal‚Äù about myself, and I was passionate about everything I loved. I dared to create a club of my own, become officers of different clubs, teach classes, and be a concert mistress of my school orchestra. 
<br><br>

        I used to blame my parents for immigrating so late, not earlier. I thought if we immigrated earlier, I wouldn‚Äôt have struggled so much. Today, I thank my parents for providing opportunities for me to be a mixture of Korean and American culture, that no one else can be. I speak both Korean and English fluently, and I am glad that I could help any Koreans and English speakers that need help translations. I love myself for who I am, for being unique, and for having such a spectacular life that no one else can experience.
